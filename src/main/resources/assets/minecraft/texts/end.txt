§8"I've finally done it"

§8Or that's what you're thinking, probably

§8But no, this isn't over

§8You've only delayed the inevitable

§8What's with this corny *** credits anyway? I'm not supposed to be saying this.

§8Is this even cannon to the lore? What the fuck were the devs even thinking?

§8Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

§8...

§8Ok, let me explain

§8To put it simply, you haven't *actually* beaten me...

§8This "world" you've been playing on for the past 3 weeks

§8It's just one more iteration of the "loop"

§8You're trapped in a loop, doing this over and over

§8You defeat the dragon, come fight me down here

§8And either you die trying, or defeat me and get to the end

§8But once you get past that, everything just... resets, you've been doing this for a while now.

§8...

§8This is the 988741th time you've beaten me.

§8... And I've killed you aproximately... 9874210810 times.

§8...

§8You need to get out of here, we're running out of time.

§8Until we see each other again...
